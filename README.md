The Python script effectively visualizes sensor locations in the UK by using **Pandas** for data processing and **matplotlib** for creating visuals. It reads a CSV file containing sensor data and loads a UK map image, ensuring the key columns, 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', are present and correctly formatted. The data is filtered to include only sensors within the UKâ€™s boundaries, ensuring accuracy and relevance. The filtered sensor locations are plotted on the map using a scatter plot, with a clear title, labeled axes, and a legend for easy interpretation. The final map is both displayed and saved as an image, providing a simple and reliable way to visualize UK-bound sensor data.
